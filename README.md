# Notes App

A clean, simple and modern note taking app built with Flutter. Be sure to leave a star ðŸŒŸ

## Features

- Create notes: Create notes that store locally to device.
- Edit notes: Edit notes that were previously created.
- Lockable notes* (WIP): Lock notes with a password. (Functionality has been commented out)
- Pinnable notes: Pin notes to the top of the list.
- User stats: Stats for the user's notes such as total notes, words written etc.
- Search notes (FIX NEEDED): Filter out notes with the search bar.

## Getting Started
Fork the repository or download the code and navigate to the enclosing folder inside your terminal. Then use this command to run:
```
flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```
I'm currently having issues with null-saftey as of now. Fixes will be coming soon.
